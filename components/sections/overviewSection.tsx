              During mysterious events, the space city "Atum" and its residents
              vanish without a trace. Three decades later, the city suddenly
              reappears in its former location, but its inhabitants remain
              inaccessible. A group of heroes embarks on a reconnaissance
              mission to this enigmatic city and realizes that all its residents
              have turned into mutants, and they must clear this dangerous city.{" "}

              Heroes must break through hordes of terrifying monsters in search
              of salvation. The game levels consist of numerous randomly
              generated floors of the space city divided into stages. Upgrading
              weapons and character abilities, completing necessary tasks to
              survive, defending the only path to salvation, and, of course,
              destroying crowds of monsters along the way - these are the
              challenges heroes will face.
